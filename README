# LeetCode REST API

A lightweight **Flask** wrapper that simplifies LeetCode data access. This project converts LeetCode's complex internal GraphQL queries into clean, user-friendly **RESTful endpoints**—eliminating the need for manual GraphQL boilerplate in your frontend.

Designed  to power the **LC_Tracker** ecosystem.

---

## 🚀 Features

* **Zero Boilerplate:** Fetch profile stats, badges, and contest data with simple `GET` requests.
* **Auto-Parsing:** Automatically converts LeetCode's stringified JSON (like the submission calendar) into proper dictionaries.

---

## 📂 Folder Structure

* `services/queries.py` — Centralized bank of LeetCode GraphQL query strings.
* `services/leetcode_client.py` — The core "engine" that handles requests and headers.
* `app.py` — API entry point and route handlers.
* `config.py` — Environment and global configuration.
